Hi my name is Maria Ana Henriques and I am a Chemical Engineer from Instituto Superior Técnico. I am currently working at Solvay as a Raw Materials Data Analyst and looking for new opportunities on the Tech world!

After 3 years working in the same team and being exposed to the same daily activities, I am certain this is the right moment to step out of my comfort zone and shift my career towards what I believe will be the future. I am very interested in the tech industry and being more involved in the lifecycle of a product, working alongside a cross-functional team in a fast-paced environment where I feel my contribution is meaningful and that we are all working towards a common goal of a more sustainable business and environment.

In the last year I graduated from a post-graduation on **product management & business development,** I started **learning code**, and **looking for opportunities** to enter the exciting tech world!
